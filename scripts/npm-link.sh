# Optionally link locally-developed packages into node_modules after install.
#
# This script links a package iff ALL THREE are true:
#   1. The package name appears in LINK_PACKAGES below.
#   2. The package is a direct entry of dependencies/devDependencies in
#      package.json (no transitive walk).
#   3. The package is currently registered as a global npm link
#      (`npm ls -g --depth=0 --link=true`).
#
# When nothing matches (e.g. on CI runners with no global links, or on a
# developer machine that has not run `npm link` in the package's repo),
# the script exits 0 without invoking `npm link`. This is the safety
# mechanism — no separate $CI guard is required.
